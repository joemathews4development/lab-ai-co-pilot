# LAB | The AI Assistant Trials, who’s the Best Co-Pilot?

> :test_tube: Focus: Critical AI comparison, Prompt Engineering, Output Review

## :brain: Scenario

Your dev team is considering integrating an AI assistant into your daily workflow, but which one fits best?

You’ve been tasked with leading **“The AI Assistant Trials”**, a side-by-side comparison between:

-  **ChatGPT (Free)**  
-  **Claude (Free)**  
-  **Your pick** (if you use another AI tool like Gemini or so)

You’ll evaluate each AI by giving them the same set of coding challenges and analysing their responses.

<br />

## :dart: Learning Goals

By completing this lab, you will:

:white_check_mark: Compare AI assistants on real-world tasks   <br>
:white_check_mark: Practice prompt clarity and iteration   <br>
:white_check_mark: Learn how to critically evaluate AI suggestions   <br>
:white_check_mark: Choose the best assistant for your own dev flow

<br />

<br>

## Requirements

- Fork this repo.
- Clone this repo.

<br>

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Solved lab"
git push origin master
```

- Create a Pull Request so that your work can be checked.

<br>

## :test_tube: Tasks

Perform **3 challenges** with each AI. You must use the **same prompt** for all three.

### :white_check_mark: Task 1: Explain a Function

**Prompt:**  
> “Explain this JavaScript function in detail. Add comments as needed.”

```js
function mysteryOp(arr) {
  return arr.reduce((acc, val) => acc ^ val, 0);
}
```

<br />

### :white_check_mark: Task 2: DOM Manipulation

**Prompt:**  
> “Write a function that changes the text of an HTML element with id `status` when a button is clicked. Use vanilla JavaScript and follow accessibility best practices.”

<br />

### :white_check_mark: Task 3: Refactor Obfuscated Code

**Prompt:**  
> “Refactor this function to make it readable and efficient. Add meaningful variable names and comments.”

```js
function r(a){let b=0;for(let i=0;i<a.length;i++){if(a[i]%2===0){b+=a[i]}}return b}
```

> 💡 Don’t just give scores write down what stood out.  
> Was one clearer, but verbose? Another too short but correct?
